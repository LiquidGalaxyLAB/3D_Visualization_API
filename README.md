# 3D_Visualization_API
My project goal for this project is to create a software library that can be integrated in Liquid Galaxy, that allows third parties to easily apply common features in Computer Graphics directly to a Liquid Galaxy format, a multi screen display cluster launching instances of Chromium OS in each machine. This would include really commonly used properties in graphics, modelling a geometric object, applying lightning, animation, shaders and even textures.
